        <h2>About Me</h2>
    
            <p>I was born in Fort Hood, TX. At 6 months of age, my family and I moved overseas because of
               my fatherâ€™s job and we ended up staying abroad for the next 10 years of my life. Prior to joining
               the clubhou.se I worked for the U.S. Air Force for 20 years and then as an Archeological lab technician
               for the Army Corps of Engineers that is sponsored through a military Veterans transition program. Although
               I never have any intention of wanting to become a web dev, I will take the tools and resources obtained in 
               this course and utilize them in my small business while working towards striving to become a better extension 
               of myself individually, for my family and community.</p>
